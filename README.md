# AIGC Mind Map

## Give AIGC a question,Output a set of mind maps for you.
---

When we ask the existing AIGC tools to ask them questions, our answers are only 1., 2., 3.

And if you want to understand this question in detail, you will most likely need to ask the AIGC tool separately

"how to do 1." or "1. what"

# For example

## üß†When I ask AIGC tools:

‚ùì**How to use cloud server to deploy web pages?**

‚ùóÔ∏èIt answered that ‚Äî‚Äî you can follow these general steps: **1. 2. 3. 4. ...... 9.**

# How AIGC Mind Map Deal This ProblemÔºü
The AIGC mind map will ask you questions that will answer multiple answers. 

Send the question through the API interface of the AIGC platform for inquiry. 

If multiple pieces of information are returned (1. 2. 3 appears in the returned information) . strip) Our platform system began to make mind maps.

## Example

Like the question of **How to use cloud server to deploy web pages?**

The first of the answers given in AIGC Ôºà1.Ôºâ is: 

**Choose a Cloud Service Provider**

And we continue to ask AIGCÔºö**How to Choose a Cloud Service ProviderÔºü**

We will receiveÔºö

123456789 steps......

And Then we will summarize all the generated information into a mind map.
                       

[After personal testing, in the process of information extraction, the information returned is a long piece of text, and it is difficult to extract one by one from it at this stage

So we now choose to only generate answers with clear 1. 2. 3. in the returned information]
