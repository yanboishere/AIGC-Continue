# AIGC-Continue
One question With AIGC，more Answer Ways.

---

When we ask the existing AIGC tools to ask them questions, our answers are only 1., 2., 3.

And if you want to understand this question in detail, you will most likely need to ask the AIGC tool separately

"how to do 1." or "1. what"

For example:

🧠When I ask AIGC tools:

❓**How to use cloud server to deploy web pages?**

❗️It answered that —— you can follow these general steps: **1. 2. 3. 4. ...... 9.**

But you can't deal your question for ask once.
